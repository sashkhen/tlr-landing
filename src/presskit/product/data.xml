  <description>
    The Long Reach is an intricate puzzle adventure where you have to run for your life.
    It’s a The Cave-ish style adventure in which your puzzles are walking, mumbling, and yelling. They went insane and are there to get you. You’ll have to work out their own personal horrors.
    The story is weird shit delivered with a serious face. We keep our focus on one feature and that is escape. Gallows humour, personal nightmares, and plain old cowardice. Characters will either take their stand or die an ignominious death.

  <features>
    <feature>Magical realism. We’re going for a usual and mundane exposition parts that are trashed and twisted and as the story unfolds.</feature>
    <feature>Psychological thriller. Most games on the market are more about the horror side while we use it to highlight the vicissitudes of psyche.</feature>
    <feature>Puzzles rely on figuring out enemies nightmares. Every enemy is somewhat insane through no fault of his own.</feature>
    <feature>Instead of pixel-hunting for objects to use you have to observe your obstacles.</feature>
    <feature>Tight focus. The game is about escaping. Every story bit and puzzle motivation rotates around escaping. Whether from an imminent threat, your girlfriend, or yourself.</feature>
    <feature>Your enemies aren’t faceless zombies or possessed puppets. They are humans whose lives and stories matter and we make sure the player knows that.</feature>
